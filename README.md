### What is Serverless ?

*The phrase “serverless” doesn’t mean servers are no longer involved. It simply means that developers no longer have to think "that much" about them. Computing resources get used as services without having to manage around physical capacities or limits.*

### Pros & Cons

**Pros**
- You do not need to manager servers, only serverless functions
- Run on-demand
- Scaling is automated (Limited by your available functions)
- Easy Pricing

**Cons**

- Be careful about timeout & memory
- Limited by time
- Cold start can be a problem
- Have a lot o lambdas working can be a pricing problem
